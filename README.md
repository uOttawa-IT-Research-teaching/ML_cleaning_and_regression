This tutorial is designed to optimize data preparation for machine learning, with a specific focus on predicting bike traffic patterns based on weather conditions. This tutorial will include a summary of the learning goals, a specific section that outlines the necessary requirements for completing the tutorial, and a section on the recommended practices for Research Data Management (RDM). By merging bike traffic and weather data from Open Data sources, we aim to ensure data integrity and consistency, rectify any errors, and enhance the dataset with additional values for improved accuracy. The tutorial employs Linear Regression, a straightforward machine learning model, to make predictions based on the input data. The data is sourced from Ottawaâ€™s bike count data via their Open Data website and historical weather data from Environment Canada. These datasets, which are already downloaded and available in the tutorial repository, are combined to create a comprehensive training dataset
